This repository contains the code for an Arduino 2-player fighting game built as a project 
for the Robotics Introduction Course taken in the 3rd year at the Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics of Bucharest.

## Requirements

Using a 8x8 Matrix display, an LCD display, joysticks and buttons, the requiremets of these project were to build a game
that would run off an Arduino Uno.

The game had to have:
